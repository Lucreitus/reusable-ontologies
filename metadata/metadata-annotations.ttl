Where the concepts overlap with established semantics in RDF or OWL 2, they are not repeated. A list of the omitted concepts is provided below.

Also note that where the concepts overlap in Dublin Core and SKOS, only one annotation property is created.  (But the mappingRelation properties will indicate both mappings.) An example of this is the correspondence between Dublin Core's title and SKOS' prefLabel.

What follows is a list of the Dublin Core Elements vocabulary and SKOS model concepts that are not included in this ontology (and why):

 - DC:format (file and mime formats) - Can be achieved using the mimeType property. 
 - DC:identifier (unambiguous reference) - The URI of an entity provides this reference.
 - DC:publisher - The source of the ontology may be determined from its IRI, copyright, or similar properties.  Typically, an ontology is made available on a web site, installed with software, etc. and is copyrighted. 
 - DC:source - The mappingRelation sub-properties (taken from SKOS) provide more explicit information regarding the source/origin of an ontology or its components.
 - DC:type (DCMI Type) - DCMI types include software, images, etc. and MIME types.  Instead of the general DCMI type, a mimeType property is defined.
 - SKOS:Concept (unit of thought) - A class definition with its metadata defines a Concept.
 - SKOS:ConceptScheme and inScheme (collection of concepts) - An ontology (and its namespace) collects related concepts.
 - SKOS:Collection, OrderedCollection, member, memberList - Will be defined in a separate ontology dealing specifically with the Collection semantic.
 - SKOS:hasTopConcept and topConceptOf (defines the top Concept in a ConceptScheme) - Can be achieved by subclassing from owl:Top for an ontology.
 - SKOS:semanticRelation, broader, narrower, related, broaderTransitive, narrowerTransitive - Can be achieved using subclassing.
 - SKOS:relatedMatch - Can be achieved by using the mappingRelation property (and not the more specific sub-properties).
